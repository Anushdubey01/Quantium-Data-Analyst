## Task Details

### Task 1: Data Preparation and Customer Analytics
- **Objective**: To analyze a large transactional dataset and identify key customer purchasing patterns to generate insights for commercial strategies.
- **Approach**:
  - **Data Cleaning**: Processed and validated transactional and customer data to ensure accuracy, removed duplicates, handled missing values, and standardized formats.
  - **Customer Segmentation**: Used purchasing behaviors to segment customers, identifying patterns based on frequency, recency, and monetary value.
  - **Visualization**: Developed charts and graphs to showcase purchasing trends, peak buying periods, and product preferences.
  - **Insight Generation**: Derived commercial insights, like customer loyalty metrics and seasonal purchasing patterns, to help strategize targeted marketing efforts.
- **Outcome**: Produced a detailed report identifying customer segments and trends that could inform business strategies for maximizing engagement and sales.

### Task 2: Experimentation and Uplift Testing
- **Objective**: To design and analyze an experiment aimed at assessing the impact of new store layouts on customer spending through uplift testing.
- **Approach**:
  - **Control Store Selection**: Applied statistical metrics (e.g., sales volume, customer demographics) to choose control stores that closely matched trial stores for fair comparisons.
  - **Uplift Testing**: Conducted statistical analyses comparing trial and control stores to detect differences in sales that could be attributed to the layout changes.
  - **Data Visualization**: Created side-by-side visualizations of trial and control store performance, highlighting any notable uplifts in sales or other key metrics.
  - **Recommendation**: Provided data-backed insights on whether the new layout had a positive effect on sales, along with actionable recommendations for rollout across other stores.
- **Outcome**: Compiled a comprehensive report on the experimentation findings, including visual aids and a clear recommendation based on statistical testing results.

### Task 3: Analytics and Commercial Application
- **Objective**: To consolidate insights from previous tasks into a structured, client-ready report, presenting findings to a Category Manager.
- **Approach**:
  - **Report Structuring**: Utilized the Pyramid Principle to organize information, ensuring clarity and logical flow from high-level recommendations to detailed insights.
  - **Data Summarization**: Extracted key insights and created succinct visualizations to convey important findings at a glance.
  - **Commercial Recommendations**: Provided clear, actionable strategies for the Category Manager, highlighting specific areas for business improvement.
  - **Presentation Design**: Developed a polished presentation using Task 1 and Task 2 findings, emphasizing data insights, trends, and recommended actions.
- **Outcome**: Delivered a structured report that connects data insights with actionable business strategies, presenting findings in a clear and professional format suitable for decision-making.

## Key Skills Developed
- **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Learned best practices for processing raw data, identifying anomalies, and ensuring high-quality, reliable datasets.
- **Statistical Testing and Experiment Design**: Developed skills in hypothesis testing, control store selection, and uplift measurement to draw valid conclusions.
- **Visualization and Reporting**: Created meaningful visualizations and concise reports, translating complex data into insights that support decision-making.
- **Commercial Insight Generation**: Practiced deriving insights with practical business applications, showcasing how data analytics can drive commercial outcomes.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages**: Python, Jupyter notebooks
- **Libraries**: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn (for data processing, visualization, and analysis)
- **Skills Applied**: Data cleaning, segmentation, uplift testing, hypothesis testing, structured report writing
